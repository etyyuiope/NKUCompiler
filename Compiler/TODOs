1. Decaying an array seems uncorrect... Fix it.

2. Implement the literal pool for constants. (maybe...:P)

3. Testcases with unexpected results:
    ../test/level2-5/080_color.sy               -> relocation truncated.
    ../test/level2-5/109_many_params2.sy        -> WA
    ...

4. Prune assembly...

5. Refactor the code ( if all testcases are passed ).
